**Serverless Compute Manifesto**

- Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling.
- No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model.
- Permanent storage lives elsewhere.
- Scales per request. Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity.
- Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs).
- Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere.
- BYOC - Bring Your Own Code.
- Metrics and logging are a universal right.

But remember "serverless" is a *frame of reference*, of course there are servers and other infrastructure needed to implement this the point is that as adeveloper/user you don't have to care so much about operations tasks.
