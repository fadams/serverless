**Metrics**

"Rather than having to implement their own metrics in each service or function we’ve built them into the platform (via Prometheus). These metrics are used to drive function scaling. That means that you’re deploying and monitoring your functions in a consistent manner"

**Commercial support**

OpenFaaS can be sponsored or supported via Patreon, OpenCollection and CommunityBridge - see https://www.openfaas.com/donate for details on current sponsors.
