TensorFlow ImageNet/Inception as an OpenFaaS function
“Imagenet” identifies what is present in a photo.
Forked version of the work by Magnus Erik Hvass Pedersen - it has been re-packaged as an OpenFaaS serverless function.

This means you can call a HTTP endpoint with a URL to an image and get back categorizations through machine learning - fast.
